Leonel Olímpio Silima
PhD Researcher · MLOps / LLMOps Engineer · AI Systems Engineer

This repository contains the source code of my professional and academic website. The project is designed to present my profile in a clear, technically grounded and internationally understandable way, with a focus on engineering practice, research background and production-oriented AI systems.

The website is published via GitHub Pages and serves as a canonical reference for recruiters, hiring managers, collaborators and automated indexing systems.

Professional profile

I am a computer engineer with advanced training in Artificial Intelligence and applied computer systems. I hold a Master’s degree in Applied Informatics and I am currently a PhD Researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP).

My core expertise lies in the engineering and operationalization of Machine Learning and Large Language Model systems. I work across the full lifecycle of AI systems, including data preparation, model development, CI/CD pipelines, cloud-native deployment, monitoring, observability and continuous evaluation.

I have professional experience as an AI Engineer, MLOps Engineer and DevOps Engineer in both enterprise and research environments, combining software engineering principles with scalable infrastructure and automation practices.

Purpose of this project

This project is intentionally implemented as a lightweight and transparent static website. It reflects how I approach engineering problems in practice: clarity over complexity, explicit design choices and long-term maintainability.

The website provides a concise overview of my skills, services and selected projects, while also acting as a stable identity anchor across professional platforms.

Technical overview

The technology stack is deliberately minimal and robust.

The frontend is built using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.
No frontend frameworks are used, in order to keep the codebase readable, auditable and easy to maintain.
The site is hosted using GitHub Pages.
SEO metadata and structured data are explicitly defined to ensure correct indexing by search engines and AI-based systems.

Repository structure

The index.html file defines the structure and content of the website.
The estilo.css file contains all layout, styling and animation rules.
The script.js file manages navigation behavior and scroll-based animations.
The CV_LEONEL2026.pdf file contains my up-to-date curriculum vitae.
The img directory contains profile images, backgrounds and project visuals.

Engineering considerations

Even as a static project, the repository follows principles that I apply consistently in larger systems: separation of concerns, readability, responsiveness, accessibility and performance. The code is structured to be easily extended or integrated into more complex delivery pipelines if required.
