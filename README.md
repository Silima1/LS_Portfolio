PhD Researcher · MLOps / LLMOps Engineer · AI Systems Engineer

This repository contains the source code of my professional and academic website. The project is designed to present my profile in a clear, technically grounded and internationally oriented way, with explicit emphasis on academic progression, international experience and production-grade AI systems.

The website is published via GitHub Pages and serves as a canonical reference for recruiters, hiring managers, research collaborators and automated indexing systems.

Professional profile

I am a computer engineer with advanced training in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and computer systems engineering. My background combines formal academic education, applied research and hands-on industry experience across multiple countries and institutional contexts.

My core expertise lies in the engineering and operationalization of Machine Learning and Large Language Model systems, including MLOps and LLMOps practices, CI/CD pipelines, cloud-native deployment, monitoring, observability and continuous evaluation. I focus on building AI systems that are reliable, scalable and suitable for real-world production environments.

Academic background

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Universidade Católica de Moçambique, where I developed a strong foundation in computer science, programming, algorithms and system fundamentals.

I completed a Master’s degree in Applied Informatics through the Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal, in collaboration with Aily Labs in Barcelona, Spain. This international academic–industry experience allowed me to work on applied machine learning and data-driven systems, combining academic rigor with real-world industrial problem solving in a European innovation context.

I am currently a PhD Researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP), one of the leading engineering institutions in Portugal. My doctoral research focuses on Artificial Intelligence systems, scalable architectures and the integration of machine learning into complex and distributed computational environments.

In parallel with my doctoral studies, I am a Junior Researcher at INESC TEC, within the LIAAD research group. In this role, I contribute to applied research projects in collaboration with international partners, addressing real-world challenges in AI, data science and intelligent systems.

International experience

My academic and professional trajectory includes international experience across Europe and Asia. I have been involved in research, development and collaboration activities in multiple European contexts, particularly in Portugal and Spain, working with universities, research institutes and industry partners.

In addition, my experience includes exposure to research and technological environments connected to China, allowing me to engage with different research cultures, technological ecosystems and perspectives on large-scale AI systems. This international exposure has strengthened my ability to work in multicultural, interdisciplinary and globally distributed teams.

Specializations and certifications

In addition to formal academic degrees, I have pursued targeted advanced training to deepen my expertise in specific technical domains.

I completed a specialization in Deep Learning through Stanford University, focusing on modern neural network architectures and practical applications.

I also completed a specialization in Generative Artificial Intelligence at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto (FCUP), with emphasis on generative models, large language models and contemporary AI workflows.

To complement my engineering background with security awareness, I hold the IBM Ethical Hacker certificate, covering fundamental concepts in cybersecurity, threat analysis and secure system design.

Professional experience and focus

I have professional experience as an AI Engineer, MLOps Engineer and DevOps Engineer in both enterprise and research environments. My work spans the full lifecycle of AI systems, from data acquisition and model development to deployment, monitoring and long-term operation.

I combine software engineering discipline with cloud infrastructure, automation and reliability practices, aiming to deliver AI systems that are not only accurate, but also maintainable, observable and aligned with real operational constraints.

Purpose of this project

This project is intentionally implemented as a lightweight and transparent static website. It reflects how I approach engineering problems in practice: clarity over unnecessary complexity, explicit design choices and long-term maintainability.

The website provides a concise overview of my skills, services and selected projects, while also acting as a stable digital identity anchor across professional, academic and international platforms.

Technical overview

The technology stack is deliberately minimal and robust.

The frontend is built using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.
No frontend frameworks are used, in order to keep the codebase readable, auditable and easy to maintain.
The site is hosted using GitHub Pages.
SEO metadata and structured data are explicitly defined to ensure correct indexing by search engines and AI-based systems.

Repository structure

The index.html file defines the structure and content of the website.
The estilo.css file contains all layout, styling and animation rules.
The script.js file manages navigation behavior and scroll-based animations.
The CV_LEONEL2026.pdf file contains my up-to-date curriculum vitae.
The img directory contains profile images, backgrounds and project visuals.

Engineering considerations

Even as a static project, the repository follows principles that I apply consistently in larger systems: separation of concerns, readability, responsiveness, accessibility and performance. The codebase is structured to be easily extended or integrated into more complex delivery pipelines if required.
